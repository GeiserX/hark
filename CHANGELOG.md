# Changelog

All notable changes to Hark are documented here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Live transcription can now stream. `--live-streaming` (also
  `$HARK_LIVE_STREAMING`, config key `live-streaming`, `liveStreaming` on
  `POST /start`) transcribes the capture continuously through the Nemotron
  multilingual streaming recognizer instead of one window per pause. Text appears
  about 2 s after being spoken, and the open line grows every 0.6 s until
  `--segment-pause` closes it, against 9 to 12 s for a whole line from the
  segmented path. Closed lines go into the transcript
  exactly as before. The open line is written nowhere; the remote-control agent
  serves it as `session.partial` on `GET /status`. Apple Silicon, with English,
  Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and German in one model (583 MB on first
  use, pre-fetch with `hark models download fluidaudio:streaming-asr`). It picks
  its own recognizer and does its own segmenting, so `-e/--engine`, `--vad`,
  `--vad-threshold` and `--gain` do not apply; hark names the ones you set on its
  stderr. It cannot translate, `--diarize-engine offline` ignores it,
  and pairing it with `-i FILE` is a usage error. Off by default: where it cannot
  run, hark prints why and the segmented path runs unchanged, so no recording
  depends on it.
- Live segmentation timing is configurable: `--segment-pause` (seconds of
  silence that end a transcript segment, default `0.7`) and `--segment-window`
  (seconds of unbroken speech after which a segment is cut anyway, default
  `12`), also `$HARK_SEGMENT_PAUSE` / `$HARK_SEGMENT_WINDOW`, config keys
  `segment-pause` / `segment-window`, and `segmentPause` / `segmentWindow` on
  `POST /start`. They set how soon a line appears in a live transcript; both the
  VAD and the amplitude (`--no-vad`) paths honour them. The pause must be 0–5 s,
  the window 1–60 s and greater than the pause. Defaults are unchanged.

### Changed
- The minimum FluidAudio version is now 0.15.3, up from 0.12.4. The streaming
  recognizer needs `StreamingNemotronMultilingualAsrManager`, which 0.12.4 does
  not have. No shipped binary moves, because the resolved pin was already
  0.15.3. What changes is the floor a downstream consumer resolves against, and
  the dependency is not streaming-only: FluidAudio also supplies the Silero VAD,
  both diarizers and the Parakeet engine.

### Fixed
- `POST /start` said a recording had begun before it had. The session was
  registered, the answer went out, and only then were the sources started, so
  everything said in between was lost. With `--live-streaming` and a recognizer
  model not yet in memory that window was 12.7 s, measured on the first streamed
  call after a reboot, and the opening of the call was simply missing from both
  the audio and the transcript. The answer now waits for the capture to be open, and
  a start that fails on the way up returns its own error instead of a `201` for a
  recording that never happened. The answer carries `capturing`, and `GET /status`
  gains a `capturing` key of its own — always present, whatever the session state
  — so a client that was answered `capturing: false` polls for it to turn true.
  The wait gives up after `$HARK_START_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 60) rather than
  hold a client through a first-ever model download, and a `POST /stop` while it
  is still waiting ends it. The HTTP server's own ceiling on a handler is raised
  to clear that wait: at its default 15 s a cold start that answered at 22.8 s was
  cut off with a `500` while the capture ran on.
- A `--system --mix` recording no longer loses the system side silently. On a
  real 71-minute call the tap went to exact digital silence twice while the
  call kept playing and hark kept reporting `recording`: with the microphone
  clocking the capture, buffers kept arriving (zeros on the tap side), so the
  stall watchdog never fired. Silence alone is no signal, since the same
  recording holds legitimate zero runs of over two minutes. So after 10 s of zeros
  (`$HARK_TAP_SILENCE_SECONDS`) hark opens a throwaway second tap for up to 3 s:
  if it hears audio the recording does not, the tap is rebuilt and the same
  file continues; if it hears nothing, nothing happens and it looks again at
  30 s, 60 s, then every minute. Rebuilds are capped at five per silent stretch
  and never stop the recording. The check only arms once the tap has been heard
  at least once: a capture with no working "System Audio Recording" grant is
  zeros from its first buffer, which is a missing permission rather than a tap
  that died, and the all-zero warning already covers it. A tap stream that is
  not 32-bit float is not judged either. `GET /status` gains
  `session.callAudio` =
  `{state: unknown|ok|silent|dead|recovered, silentFor, restarts}`, where
  `unknown` means nothing has been measured: the tap has not delivered audio
  yet, or the throwaway tap could not be built to judge a run of zeros. It is
  not `silent`, which is a measured quiet room. A tap stream hark cannot read
  omits the field altogether.
  Why the tap dies is still unknown; the rebuild logs the output device, its
  sample rate and the tap format to help find out.
- Diarized batch transcription (`hark -i FILE --speakers`, and the end-of-capture
  `--diarize-engine offline` pass) no longer loses short utterances. It only
  transcribed audio that fell inside a diarizer segment, and FluidAudio discarded
  every segment shorter than `minSpeechDuration` — 1.0 s by default, which hark
  never overrode — so a 0.55 s "Hello." that plain batch transcribed fine never
  reached the recognizer at all. The floor is now 0.25 s: low enough to keep
  those turns, high enough to stay above the pipeline's own ~0.17 s activity
  floor, which is what stops a brief noise burst creating a spurious
  `Speaker N`. On a 26-turn two-voice clip (clean, and again with room noise and
  taps) every turn from 0.4 s up now survives, the speaker count stays at the
  true two, and no turn the old floor already transcribed changes its words or
  its speaker. A span shorter than the recognizer's own floor is now padded with
  trailing silence instead of being handed over short or skipped, so a real
  quarter-second answer is transcribed rather than aborting the whole run with
  "Must be at least 300ms of 16kHz audio" and writing no transcript. The floor
  is asked from the backend (`minimumAudioSeconds`), so it tracks FluidAudio's
  own constant and stays zero for whisper, apple and whisperkit.
- `--speaker-mode source` now works on a two-channel file. An interview or call
  recorded with your microphone on the left channel and the other side on the
  right is transcribed one channel at a time and labeled by origin —
  `You`/`Others`, or whatever `--speaker-labels` says — then merged into one
  time-ordered transcript. Because the two voices never share a track, people
  talking over each other both survive, which a mixed recording cannot do at
  all. The labels are fixed by channel, but finding each channel's speech is
  still the offline diarizer's job, so this needs Apple Silicon and the diarizer
  model like every other `-i --speakers` run; only live source attribution is
  model-free. `--speaker-mode auto` is unchanged: a stereo file is still
  diarized as one recording, since most stereo is not one speaker per channel.

### Changed
- `-i FILE --speakers --speaker-mode source` on a file that has no two channels
  to attribute (mono, or more than two) is now a usage error naming the channel
  count, instead of being ignored. It used to produce a `Speaker 1/2…`
  transcript that looked labeled but told you nothing about who was who.

### Fixed
- Reading a stereo file threw away the right channel. Everything that folds a
  file down to mono — transcription, offline diarization, and a transcode to
  `--channels 1` — asked `AVAudioConverter` for the channel change, and it keeps
  channel 0 instead of mixing, so an interview recorded with one speaker per
  channel came back as half a conversation and a right-channel-only file
  transcribed as silence. hark now averages the channels itself before the
  conversion; a file with identical channels keeps its level, and averaging
  (rather than summing) cannot clip. An anti-phase stereo file (L = -R) now
  folds to silence, as any mono fold does. Recorded audio is unchanged, byte
  for byte. Live transcription changes on one path: without the Silero VAD —
  Intel, `--no-vad`, or the model failing to load — segments reach the engine
  in the capture format, which is stereo for system capture, through this same
  decode, so live transcription now hears both channels too.
- `--tracks mixed|stereo` (also `$HARK_TRACKS`, config `tracks`, and the
  remote-control `tracks` field). A meeting capture already has two separate
  signals — your microphone and the call — but the saved `-a` file was their
  sum, with left and right identical, so the separation was gone the moment the
  file was written. `--tracks stereo` keeps them apart in the same single file:
  the microphone on the left channel, the system/app audio on the right, ready
  for `ffmpeg -filter_complex channelsplit` or any editor. It needs two sources
  (`--mix` with `--system`/`--app`/`--exclude-app`) and both channels, and says
  so instead of quietly falling back. Each side is folded to mono, so a
  genuinely stereo system signal is downmixed. `mixed` stays the default and is
  unchanged.

### Fixed
- The separated `--speakers` tracks (the live transcribers, and the temporary
  WAVs the offline diarizer records) were written straight from the audio
  callback, so they skipped the three guards the mixed stream has. `--duration`
  never reached them: each track kept everything its source delivered until the
  stream was torn down, so it ran long by however long teardown took, with no
  ceiling — nine 2 s captures here overran by 3–8 ms on the mic track and by
  80–240 ms on the system track. Pause was read at a different point in the
  pipeline than for the mixed stream, so a busy IO queue could keep a chunk on
  one side and drop it on the other, and a chunk still arriving during teardown
  could reach an already-finalized writer. Each track now hops to the capture IO
  queue like the mixed stream and honours the same stop flag, pause state, and
  duration budget.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- A capture that can't reach the audio stream — most often a missing or stale
  "System Audio Recording" grant — could block forever in the Core Audio
  teardown, taking the whole recording with it. Stopping is now bounded
  (`$HARK_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT`, default 5 s): hark reports the problem and
  finalizes the outputs anyway, so the audio captured so far stays playable.
  Late chunks arriving from the audio thread during teardown are dropped instead
  of racing the sinks being finalized.
- The remote-control agent handled such a capture badly: because captures share
  one serial queue and `POST /stop` marks the session `stopped` optimistically,
  the next `POST /start` returned `201` and then never recorded, while
  `GET /status` still showed `stopped` with `error: null` — the agent looked
  healthy but was dead. Now a stop that doesn't complete within
  `$HARK_STOP_TIMEOUT` (default 10 s) marks the session `failed` with an
  explanatory error, and a `POST /start` behind a stuck worker is refused with
  `409` instead of being silently accepted. Agent shutdown notes a
  still-finishing capture in the service log.

### Documentation
- PRD §6.1 documented `--speakers[=auto|source|acoustic]`, which the binary
  rejects; it now describes the shipped `--speakers` + `--speaker-mode` pair (the
  example too). Feature 11 is marked WAV-only with MP4/ID3 deferred, Feature 14
  gains the shipped `parakeet` engine, and a new §9 milestone row covers the
  output-protection and reliability work.
- PRD §5 acceptance criteria are ticked where a test, verification script, or
  recorded live run demonstrates the behaviour (28 of 64), with a header
  defining what a checked box means; the rest stay open as TCC/GUI/soak-gated or
  not-yet-built.
- PLAN: the legal-docs phase is closed (it shipped in 0.4.0), stale placeholders
  resolved, and new phases added for this fix and for the unbuilt PRD M9
  (interactive shortcuts + combined agent).
- man page gains a `RESPONSIBLE USE` section plus `HARK_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT` and
  `HARK_STOP_TIMEOUT`; `docs/reference.md` documents bounded teardown;
  `docs/remote-control.md` documents wedged-capture semantics.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- Existing output files are protected instead of silently clobbered. Before
  capture starts — before permission prompts and model loading — Hark checks
  every file the run would write (audio, transcript, `--split` chunk set) and
  applies the new `--if-exists ask|error|overwrite|unique` (also
  `$HARK_IF_EXISTS`, config `if-exists`). The whole invocation is one artifact
  set: a single decision covers every output, and `unique` picks one suffix that
  is free for all of them, so an audio/transcript pair stays aligned
  (`rec-1.m4a` + `rec-1.txt`). New exit code **73** (`EX_CANTCREAT`) for a
  refusal or a cancelled prompt.
- `POST /start` on the remote-control agent accepts `ifExists` and defaults to
  `unique`, so an API-driven session never blocks on a prompt and never
  overwrites a previous recording; the response and `GET /status` report the
  paths actually being written. An `ifExists: "error"` collision maps to `409`.
- Naming the input as an output (`-i rec.wav -a rec.wav`), pointing `-a` and
  `-t` at the same file, or writing to a directory are now clear errors instead
  of a corrupt or cryptic result.

### Changed
- **Behaviour change:** a run whose output file already exists no longer
  overwrites it. On a terminal you are asked (`[o]verwrite  [u]nique
  [c]ancel`); off a terminal (cron, pipes, `hark | …`) the run refuses with exit
  73. Restore the old behaviour globally with `hark config set if-exists
  overwrite`, or per-run with `--if-exists overwrite`. To accumulate
  transcripts, append in the shell: `hark -t - >> notes.txt`.
- `examples/hark-meeting` now picks the next free `-N` name itself when a
  meeting with the same name was already recorded today (so the summary step
  still finds the transcript), and both it and `examples/hark-note` pass
  `--if-exists error` so a collision is a loud failure rather than a prompt or a
  rename behind the script's back.
- `examples/hark-meeting` now asks which fabric pattern to summarize with,
  instead of always using `summarize_meeting`. The prompt is an `fzf` picker over
  the installed patterns with the pattern's own text in a preview pane
  (`fabric-ai --readpattern`), and it runs *after* the recording — so the choice
  can be made having heard how the meeting went. Behaviour change: leaving
  `$FABRIC_PATTERN` unset now prompts rather than silently defaulting; set it
  (e.g. `FABRIC_PATTERN=summarize_meeting`) to keep the old non-interactive
  behaviour. Falls back to `summarize_meeting` whenever the picker can't or
  shouldn't run: no `fzf` installed (with a hint on stderr), stdin not a
  terminal (silently, so cron/CI stay quiet), or the picker cancelled with Esc.
  `fzf` is an optional dependency — the recipe still works without it.

### Fixed
- The WAV, MP3, Opus, and live-transcript writers created their output with
  `FileManager.createFile` and then opened it with a `FileHandle`, which does
  **not** truncate — so if the create step failed, new data was written over an
  existing file's stale trailing bytes, yielding a corrupt hybrid. They now use
  a single `open(2)` with `O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`.
- `examples/hark-meeting --help` printed a stray blank line and `set -euo
  pipefail` after the header, because it extracted a hardcoded line range. It
  now stops at the first non-comment line, so the header can grow freely.
- `examples/hark-meeting` now saves and restores the terminal's `stty` state
  around the recording. Hark restores cbreak mode itself on the normal paths,
  but if it is killed before installing its signal handler (e.g. Ctrl-C during a
  first-run model download) the terminal was left with no echo, which would also
  have broken the new pattern picker.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- The remote-control agent's `GET /status` reported a stale hardcoded version
  (`0.1.0`) — it now reports the real hark version, from a new single-source
  `harkVersion` constant (also used by `--version` and the WAV-metadata tag).
- `GET /status` reported the raw `--remote-control` value as `address` (a bare
  flag showed just `"8473"`); it now reports the parsed bound address
  (`127.0.0.1:8473`).
- A clean SIGTERM/SIGINT stop of the agent was misreported as
  "remote-control server could not start … (is the port already in use?)" and
  exited non-zero — every `brew services stop` logged a bogus fatal error. The
  agent now shuts down silently and exits 0.
- The "captured only silence" TCC warning never fired when a permission-less
  system tap delivered no bytes at all (the exact background-service failure
  mode, which produced header-only files with no visible error). It now also
  fires for zero-byte captures (≥ 2 s) and mentions granting the permission to
  the hark binary itself for background (brew-services) use.

### Changed
- The Homebrew service now sets launchd `KeepAlive` (a crashed agent is
  relaunched, throttled and logged; a clean stop stays stopped), and the
  formula prints caveats for macOS 26: launchd does not spawn a
  newly-bootstrapped agent mid-session, so the first `brew services start`
  needs one `launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/homebrew.mxcl.hark` (or a
  re-login).

### Documentation
- Validated the brew-services agent end-to-end under launchd on macOS 26 (mic +
  system audio + transcription + mute API) and documented the TCC story:
  permissions attribute directly to the hark binary; system audio needs a
  one-time manual grant (and may need re-granting after upgrades — grants are
  path-recorded against the versioned Cellar path). New "Background service"
  section in docs/permissions.md; service section rewritten in
  docs/remote-control.md; PRD Open Q4 resolved.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- `docs/legal.md`: export classification (ancillary-cryptography exclusion and
  the publicly-available open-source carve-out → EAR99 self-classification),
  encryption import/registration regimes, why TCC-gated overt capture is not
  interception/intrusion software, and responsible-use / recording-consent
  notes. Linked from a new README "Legal & responsible use" section. (Shipped in
  this release; the entry was missed at the time.)
- Remote-control mic mute parity: the agent now exposes `POST /mute` and
  `POST /unmute` (idempotent; silence only the mic, timeline preserved — distinct
  from `/pause`), `GET /status` reports a `muted` field, and `POST /start` accepts
  `{"muted": true}` to begin muted. Muting a capture with no microphone returns
  `422`. The transcript yank stays interactive-only.
- The remote-control agent can run as a background service via Homebrew:
  `brew services start hark` runs it as a per-user LaunchAgent (auto-starts at
  login). The service binds the new `remote-control-port` config key (default
  `8473`, also `$HARK_REMOTE_CONTROL_PORT`) and runs with `--no-keep-awake`. No
  launchd `KeepAlive` on purpose — a crash or bad start stays down and visible
  rather than relaunching in a hidden loop. See
  [docs/remote-control.md](docs/remote-control.md#running-as-a-service-brew-services).
- `--remote-control` now takes an **optional** value: omit it to bind loopback on
  the configured `remote-control-port` (an explicit `[host:]port` still wins).
- The reference Google Meet userscript now ships as a standalone file,
  [`examples/hark-meet.user.js`](examples/hark-meet.user.js) (Tampermonkey
  one-click install + self-update), and **mirrors your Meet mic mute to the
  recording** one-way (Meet → hark): it starts with `muted` matching Meet's
  state at join, then `POST /mute`/`/unmute` as you toggle — near-instant via a
  DOM observer with a 2s poll fallback. `docs/remote-control.md` now links the
  file instead of embedding it.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Two interactive controls (`--interactive`): **m** mutes/unmutes the
  microphone — only the mic is silenced, so any system audio keeps recording and
  the timeline is preserved (distinct from pause, which omits the interval); the
  hint shows it only when a mic is in the capture. **y** yanks the transcript
  captured so far to the system clipboard (local only, no network).

### Fixed
- The VAD segmenter no longer deadlocks the Swift cooperative thread pool, which
  could stall live transcription (and hung CI).

### Documentation
- Overhauled the README (hero banner, demo GIF, use cases including fabric-ai
  pipelines, star CTA), added `docs/reference.md` and community-health files, and
  switched the direct-binary onboarding default to on-device Parakeet v3.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- Live transcription no longer drops whole turns. The segmenter only transcribed
  Silero-VAD-detected speech and discarded everything else, so quiet or
  overlapping speech (e.g. remote participants picked up over a room mic) was
  lost — on a real 57-minute meeting ~a third of the words the same recognizer
  captures from the whole file were missing. The segmenter now covers the entire
  timeline (the VAD only chooses clean cut points; a max-window cut covers
  speech it misses), skipping only true silence. Measured coverage on that
  meeting rose from ~65% to ~80% of the whole-file baseline.
- A single segment that fails to transcribe no longer aborts the rest of the
  transcript; the failure is logged and that segment skipped (only a closed
  output pipe stops capture).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Capture now **auto-recovers from interruptions** (screen lock, display/system
  sleep, device/route change). A stall watchdog notices when the stream stops
  delivering audio and restarts the microphone, system-tap, or ScreenCaptureKit
  session, resuming automatically — previously a lock/sleep killed capture and
  the transcript silently stopped. Tunable via `$HARK_STALL_SECONDS` and
  `$HARK_RECOVER_TIMEOUT` (a bounded clean-stop fallback, off by default), or
  disable with `$HARK_NO_RECOVER`.
- `--keep-awake` / `--no-keep-awake` (also `$HARK_KEEP_AWAKE` and
  `hark config set keep-awake`): keep the machine awake while recording so idle
  sleep can't interrupt a long capture. Off by default; in `--interactive` it
  also keeps the display on.

### Fixed
- Live transcription no longer drops words or whole phrases on longer
  recordings. The VAD segmenter resampled each captured chunk independently
  (a fresh converter per chunk), so the 16 kHz clock that drives segment
  boundaries drifted from the captured audio and the error accumulated over
  time — progressively misaligning, clipping, and eventually dropping late
  turns. The segmenter now resamples the stream through one continuous resampler
  and slices each turn directly from that 16 kHz buffer by sample index (a
  single clock), and feeds whisper the already-16 kHz audio without a second
  resample.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-20

First public beta. A native macOS CLI (single Swift binary) that captures
microphone and system/per-app audio, saves transcription-friendly recordings,
transcribes them, and composes into Unix pipelines.

### Capture
- Live capture from the default/`-d` microphone, all system audio (`--system`),
  specific apps (`--app`, repeatable), or everything except some (`--exclude-app`).
- `--mix` to combine the microphone with a system/app capture (clock-synced).
- Two interchangeable backends — ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 15+) and Core Audio
  process taps (macOS 14.4+, headless) — via `--capture-backend auto|sckit|coreaudio`.
- `--duration`, `--split duration=SEC|silence=SEC`, configurable rate/bits/channels.

### Formats
- Audio output to WAV, M4A, FLAC, MP3 (vendored LAME), and Opus; `--format` override.
- WAV streaming on stdout (`-a -`) and raw PCM (`--raw`) for pipelines.
- `hark -i IN -a OUT` transcodes between formats; `hark info <file>` inspects them.

### Transcription
- Engines via `--engine`: `whisper` (whisper.cpp, default), `apple`
  (Speech.framework, on-device), `whisperkit` and `parakeet` (CoreML, Apple Silicon).
- `--language` (auto-detect by default), `--translate`, transcript output as
  `.txt`/`.srt`/`.json` (`-t`), near-real-time live transcription.

### Speaker labeling
- `--speakers` (`--diarize`): source attribution (You/Others) and acoustic
  diarization (`Speaker N`), live (streaming LS-EEND) or offline; Apple-Silicon-first.

### Interactive & remote control
- `--interactive`: minimal terminal UI with space=pause/resume, Enter=finish;
  the live transcript shows on screen and is concurrently saved when `-t FILE`
  is named.
- `--remote-control [host:]port`: loopback HTTP/JSON control agent
  (start/stop/pause/resume/status) with a Tampermonkey Google-Meet reference
  userscript. See docs/remote-control.md.

### Configuration & UX
- Settings resolve flag › `$HARK_*` › `~/.hark/config.json` › built-in default;
  `hark config show/set/unset/path`. `hark models list/download` manages models.
- `-C/--directory` base directory for relative artifact paths; startup status on
  stderr; POSIX exit codes.

### Examples
- `examples/` recipe scripts: `hark-meeting`, `hark-note`, `hark-dictate`.

### Notes
- Requires macOS 14.4+. The prebuilt binary is Apple Silicon (arm64); Intel users
  build from source. The `whisper` engine needs an external whisper.cpp binary.
- The release binary is signed (Developer ID) and notarized, so it passes
  Gatekeeper; its stable code identity keeps privacy grants across upgrades.
